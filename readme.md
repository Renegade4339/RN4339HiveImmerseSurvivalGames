# Immerse Survival Games

This pack was made since 2024 and (still) is designed for Hive Bedrock's Survival gamemode.

## Theming?

Sci-Fi and Post-Apocalyptic. Perhaps give SG some love, aye?

## Installation

(For Android users only)
Open the tab options menu and enable desktop view (or anything similar to it).

Press the big green `Code` button and press the `Download ZIP` button. From there, you have two options:

1. Open the ZIP file and drag it to your resourcepacks directory (Harder route)
2. Rename the file extention to .mcpack and open it. (Easier route)

## Caveat

This pack is designed for Hive's Survival gamemode and as such will conflict anything else.
